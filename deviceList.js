// Add a devices hostname or ip as a string (within single quotation marks) to the array below.
// Ensure that each string is seperated by a comma.
// IP EX: '192.168.1.1' - If adding the device by IP, ensure that the IP is static.
// Hostname EX:  'ciscodx80'. Adding a hostname requires a valid DNS record. 
// You may need to add the domain if DNS suffix search order does not have the correct domain.
